# Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains two machine learning assignments, one focused on **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification** and the other on **Clustering Algorithms**. Both assignments aim to explore and implement different machine learning models to analyze and classify data effectively.

## Folders:

- **Part1**: SVM Classification assignment.
- **Part2**: Clustering Algorithms assignment.

## Assignment 1: SVM Classification

In this assignment, we explore the use of **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classification tasks. SVM is a supervised learning algorithm commonly used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes in a high-dimensional space.

### Key Features:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for SVM.
- **Model Training**: Train SVM classifiers with different kernels, including linear, polynomial, and RBF.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Explore the impact of hyperparameters such as `C` and `gamma` on model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

### To Run:

1. Install required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Open the `22CS30062_ass3_Part1.ipynb` file in a Jupyter notebook and follow the steps to load data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Assignment 2: Clustering Algorithms

This assignment explores various **Clustering Algorithms** including **K-Means**, **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**, and **DBSCAN**. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups data points into clusters based on their similarity.

### Key Features:

- **K-Means Clustering**: Implement K-Means clustering and analyze cluster centers and assignments.
- **Agglomerative Clustering**: Perform hierarchical clustering and visualize the dendrogram.
- **DBSCAN**: Explore density-based clustering and identify noise points.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index to evaluate clustering performance.

### To Run:

1. Install required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Open the `22CS30062_ass3_Part2.ipynb` file in a Jupyter notebook and follow the steps to apply clustering algorithms and evaluate results.
